Timebox Game
The Timebox Game is a React-based interactive grid game where users can click on grid cells to "paint" them. Once a specified number of cells are painted, the game triggers a countdown to reset the colors.

Features
Interactive Grid: Users can click on any cell to change its color to green.
Countdown Mechanism: After painting 7 cells, the game starts a countdown that resets the cell colors back to yellow in reverse order.
Dynamic Styling: Cell styles are updated dynamically based on user interaction.
